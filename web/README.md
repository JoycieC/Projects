Fantasies can come from wings
Sometimes it's a nursery tale 
At other times, it's a gloomy and, stormy night 
 
Fantasies can seem so real 
Because I felt so sad 
Searching for my own faith, yes I will never give it up 
 
We are borderless! 
Across time and space, we can sail 
Blaze all borders with you 
Shining stars waiting for you forever 
Take me to many planets, if you can do it 
 
Fight on past the space frontier 
Keep on, we are just space travelers 
We do it for our treasures 
We are borderless! 
 
Fight on past the space frontier 
Keep on, we are just space travelers 
Beyond imagination 
We are borderless! 
 
In your eyes, am I alive? 
Or still I might, not be here now 
Which one do you choose? 
Truth is not all there is 
 
In your mind, what can you see? 
It's not clear between, the past and future 
We have to fight 
 
In my eyes, what should I believe? 
All is the miracle I imagine 
But I scare them, I wanna break free from my fear! 
 
It's not clear between 
Dreams and reality 
Oh it's strange, but it's just true 
We have some visions! 
 
Fantasies can come from wings 
Sometimes it's a nursery tale 
At other times, it's a gloomy and, stormy night 
 
Fantasies can seem so real 
Because I felt so sad 
Searching for my own faith, yes I will never give it up 

We are borderless! 
Across time and space, we can sail 
Blaze all borders with you 
Shining stars waiting for you forever 
Take me to many planets, if you can do it 
 
Fight on past the space frontier 
Keep on, we are just space travellers 
We do it for our treasures 
We are borderless! 
 
Fight on past the space frontier 
Keep on, we are just space travellers 
Beyond imagination 
We are borderless!
