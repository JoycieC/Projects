<br>Fantasies can come from wings
<br>Sometimes it's a nursery tale 
<br>At other times, it's a gloomy and, stormy night 
<br> 
<br>Fantasies can seem so real 
<br>Because I felt so sad 
<br>Searching for my own faith, yes I will never give it up 
<br> 
<br>We are borderless! 
<br>Across time and space, we can sail 
<br>Blaze all borders with you 
<br>Shining stars waiting for you forever 
<br>Take me to many planets, if you can do it 
<br> 
<br>Fight on past the space frontier 
<br>Keep on, we are just space travelers 
<br>We do it for our treasures 
<br>We are borderless! 
<br> 
<br>Fight on past the space frontier 
<br>Keep on, we are just space travelers 
<br>Beyond imagination 
<br>We are borderless! 
<br> 
<br>In your eyes, am I alive? 
<br>Or still I might, not be here now 
<br>Which one do you choose? 
<br>Truth is not all there is 
<br> 
<br>In your mind, what can you see? 
<br>It's not clear between, the past and future 
<br>We have to fight 
<br> 
<br>In my eyes, what should I believe? 
<br>All is the miracle I imagine 
<br>But I scare them, I wanna break free from my fear! 
<br> 
<br>It's not clear between 
<br>Dreams and reality 
<br>Oh it's strange, but it's just true 
<br>We have some visions!
