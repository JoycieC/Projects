<br>In your eyes, am I alive? 
<br>Or still I might, not be here now 
<br>Which one do you choose? 
<br>Truth is not all there is

<br>In your mind, what can you see? 
<br>It's not clear between, the past and future 
<br>We have to fight

<br>In my eyes, what should I believe? 
<br>All is the miracle I imagine 
<br>But I scare them, I wanna break free from my fear!

<br>It's not clear between 
<br>Dreams and reality 
<br>Oh it's strange, but it's just true 
<br>We have some visions!

A modification of the English patch by Arks-Layer to alter various NPC, Enemy, Item and Area names to match their official names based on released merchandise, in-game credits and so forth.

This is applied on-top of an existing installation of the Arks-Layer patch using a .bps patch, no content from the Arks-Layer patch is included.

This patch is for testing purposes only and is not intended for widespread rlease.

Instructions:
