        <h2 class="mb-5">FAQ</h2>

<br><strong>Q)</strong> What is this?
<br><strong>A)</strong> A patch intended to alter various NPC, Enemy, Item and Area names to match their official names based on released merchandise, in-game credits etc.
<br>
<br><strong>Q)</strong> When was this project started?
<br><strong>A)</strong> 18/07/2017 - Yes, 2017. The project was used internally by us for a long time until we lost interest in the game, we've since continued work starting from scratch and hope to continue as time goes on.
<br>
<br>Here are some screenshots taken back in 2017:<br>
<br><a href="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/wopal.png">Change to Wopal</a> - Instances of Vopar being changed to Wopal, its correct name.
<br><a href="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/wiiu.png">Wii U Port</a> - An attempt at breathing new life into the late Wii U, also Xbox support in 2017!
<br><a href="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/barrelroll.png">Obligatory Star Fox reference</a> - Note the Client Version, this was a long time ago now!
<br>
<br><strong>Q)</strong> How do I apply this?
<br><strong>A)</strong> Check below for instructions.
<br>
<br><strong>Q)</strong> Does this use any content from the open source patch by Arks-Layer?
<br><strong>A)</strong> No, this only changes things in the existing Arks-Layer patch, this is not an English patch on its own and requires the Arks-Layer patch to function.
<br>
<br><strong>Q)</strong> Who made this?
<br><strong>A)</strong> JoycieC and his team are behind the Deuman patch.
<br>
<br><strong>Q)</strong> Who's in the team? Can I meet them? Do you play PSO2?
<br><strong>A)</strong> Our team consists of a small circle of friends who work on projects like this for fun. For reasons of their own, the others do not wish to disclose their involvement.
<br>
<br><strong>Q)</strong> How can I revert back to the original patch?
<br><strong>A)</strong> Delete the patch and re-enable automatic updates in the Tweaker.
<br>
<br><strong>Q)</strong> Your website isn't very good...
<br><strong>A)</strong> Because none of us are Web Devs, we're beginner at best. Let us know if you can provide an alternative!
<br>
<br><strong>Q)</strong> Is everything really correct?
<br><strong>A)</strong> Based on official merch and the end credits, we've known for years that Lisa ir Risa, Jean is Jan, Claris Claes is Klariskrays, Klotho is Chroto, and so forth. Franca's name is spelled in plain (PSO2 style) English at the top of her cafe, yet for some reason she is still 'Franka' in the Arks-Layer patch. One of the biggest arguments for some of these names is "SEGA doesn't know English!!!!" and "But the space satelites are the basis for the names!". whilst this may be true in some cases and holds merit, one must also consider that Phantasy Star in and of itself has a history of bastardising many names, it's part of the franchise and a very important thing to consider. It's done on purpose, not always due to bad translation. "But what about the formal wear in PSU!", in an instance like that, it seems someone made a typo and it never got corrected to FOmarl as it should have in Q&A, that's all.
<br>
<br><strong>Q)</strong> Have you guys tried working with Arks-Layer instead?
<br><strong>A)</strong> Not directly, but in the past we have expressed the desire for optional name changes to their official ones, (Klotho vs Chroto, Vopar vs Wopal), however this was never met positively, which is why this project was started.
<br>
<br><strong>Q)</strong> I'm from Arks-Layer and I don't like this!
<br><strong>A)</strong> <a href="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/kingrappy.png">Here</a>
<br>
<br><strong>Q)</strong> No really, take this down now!
<br><strong>A)</strong> This exists for a reason, until you can provide an alternative this will remain right here.
<br>
<br><strong>Q)</strong> I have a problem, who can I contact about this?
<br><strong>A)</strong> The best person to contact would be JoycieC, he can be found on Reddit, Discord or in PSO2, his in-game player ID is 'Joycie' on Ship 2.
<br>
<br><strong>Q)</strong> I have another question that isn't related to the above.
<br><strong>A)</strong> Same as the previous answer, contact Joycie.

        <h2 class="mb-5">Instructions</h2>
<p>Whilst using the PSO2 Tweaker, enable manual patching, this will stop the PSO2 Tweaker from deleting your patch.tar file and replacing it with the Arks-Layer version every time it boots up.
<br>
<br>We use Flips (Beat can also be used) to patch the PSO2 translation using a .bps patch file, this allows us to offer our changes whilst not using any of the source content. This is essentially storing the difference in data between the patches, and applying the difference from ours to the original.
<br>
<br>If we can find a better way to provide the patches we'll look into it.
<br>If you're using the PS Vita version, the process is the same as below except you must place your patched cpk into the appropriate RePatch folder on your PS Vita. More detailed instructions will be available at a later date.
<br>
<br>
<p><a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=11474">Download Flips here</p></a>
<br>

<p>Open the PSO2 Tweaker and select 'Tweaker Settings'</p>

<p>Enable checking for updates manually</p>

  <img src="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/manualpatch.png" alt="Enable Manual Patch"></a>
<br>
<br>
<p>Navigate to your PSO2 installation directory, generally this is similar to:
<br>
<br><strong>PHANTASYSTARONLINE2\pso2_bin\patches</strong>
<br>
<br>Run flips.exe that you downloaded earlier and select 'Apply Patch'</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/applypatch.png">
  <img src="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/applypatch.png" alt="Apply bps"></a>
<br>
<br>
<p>Select the Deuman Patch of your choice</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/openbpspatch.png">
  <img src="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/openbpspatch.png" alt="Select Deuman Patch"></a>
<br>
<br>
<p>Select the original patch (patch.tar)</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/openpatchtar.png">
  <img src="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/openpatchtar.png" alt="Select original patch"></a>
<br>
<br>
<p>Select to save your new patch over the old patch</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/savepatchtar.png">
  <img src="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/savepatchtar.png" alt="Save patch"></a>
<br>
<br>
<p>It will ask to confirm replacing the patch, select 'Yes'</p>
<a target="_blank" href="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/replacepatchtar.png">
  <img src="https://joyciec.github.io/Projects/web/img/replacepatchtar.png" alt="Replace patch"></a>
<br>
<br>
<br>Once you have done this, start PSO2 via the PSO2 Tweaker and you should now be running the Deuman Patch.
Please report any bugs via the git repo. Please note that this patch can and will break when new updates are provided to PSO2, as such it is recommded to always check for the latest version before using this patch.
To revert back to the original patch, just re-enable automatic updates in the Tweaker Settings and it'll do the rest.
